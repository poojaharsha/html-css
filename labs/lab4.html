				My most favorite hobby is photography. I always wondered as a kid how a camera works and has been passionate about it since then. I would always look at beautiful photos taken by photographers around the world and get inspired. Photography inspires me for a millions of reasons. The one that inspires me the most is I get to travel to different places for it.
