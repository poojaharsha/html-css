			<!-- Evil twins risk and precaution -->
			<h2>Evil Twins</h2>
			<p>They are designed to look like real hotspots. But when users log in to them, they unknowingly expose their passwords and other sensitive information to hackers.</p>
			<p>Precaution: Warnings signs that hotspot users should watch for are unusual variations in the lettering, logo or wording of legitimate hotspots.<br>More: <a href="http://blog.lifestore.aol.com/2013/03/10/public-wifi-hotspot-security" target="_blank">Evil twins</a></p>
			<!-- Other possible risks you can think of related to using a Wi-Fi hotspot and precautions  -->
			<h2>Man-in-the-Middle Attack:</h2>
			<p>The attacker keeps himself between two parties, making them believe that they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when actually the entire conversation is being controlled by the attacker.</p>
			<p>Precaution: Never connect to open WiFi routers directly. If you wish to so, you can use a browser plug-in such as HTTPS Everywhere or ForceTLS. These plug-ins will help you establishing a secure connection whenever the option is available.<br>More: <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/man-in-the-middle-attack" target="_blank">Man-in-the-Middle Attack</a></p>

			<h2>Rogue ad hoc networks:</h2>
			<p>With names like "Free Public WiFi," these networks can turn up wherever there are public WiFi hotspots and can be used to trick unsuspecting WiFi users into connecting to them. Not all ad hoc networks are created by hackers. But it's impossible to distinguish the real ones from the fakes.</p>
			<p>Precaution: Usage of air-monitors / wireless intrusion prevention systems can continuously scan the network and identify any live ad hoc network and report to the administrator.<br>More: <a href="http://www.excitingip.com/2293/wifi-adhoc-networks-what-they-are-how-to-mitigate-the-threats-posed-by-them" target="_blank">Rogue ad hoc networks</a></p>
			<!-- My risk while using Wi-Fi hotspot and new precautions that I would take next time -->
			<h2>I have used a Wi-Fi hotspot and I was concerned about Sniffer software</h2>
			<p>Sniffer software allows a hacker to monitor the traffic traveling to and from a computer that's connected to a public network. This can eavesdrop on emails and chats, capturing log-ins and personal or financial information.</p>
			<p>New precautions I will take the next time I use one: Only use websites that are encrypted – ones that begin with https, not http, and display a security icon such as a padlock. This will protect any confidential information you exchange with those sites at hotspots.<br>More: <a href="http://blog.lifestore.aol.com/2013/03/10/public-wifi-hotspot-security" target="_blank">Sniffer software</a></p>
			<!-- Possiblity of surfing safely using a Wi-Fi hotspot -->
			<h2>Safe surfing using a Wi-Fi hotspot</h2>
			<p>It is possible to surf safely using a Wi-Fi hotspot.</p>
			<p>Precaution: Look over your Settings and disable sharing. Ensure that your software is up to date. Use a Virtual Private Network. VPNs encrypt all the data travelling to and from your laptop and other mobile devices by sending it through a secure tunnel that's invisible to hackers.<br>More: <a href="https://www.surfeasy.com/blog/3-ways-to-stay-safe-on-starbucks-wi-fi/?lang=0" target="_blank">Safe surfing using a Wi-Fi hotspot</a></p>
