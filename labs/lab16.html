			<!-- the facts about the second athlete -->
			<p>Fact 1: Out of the fog and into the record books, Norway's Ole Einar Bjoerndalen became the most decorated Winter Olympian of all time after winning his 13th medal.Bjoerndalen had matched Daehlie's record when he won the men's sprint on the opening first Saturday of the Games. He could win a 14th medal in the men's relay on Saturday.</p>
			<p>Fact 2: Fog and overcast weather at the Laura venue where the cross-country and biathlon events were taking place had caused a string of races to be rearranged. But that did not stop the Norwegian winning his 13th medal and his eighth gold, in the biathlon mixed relay.</p>
			<p>Fact 3: He began his Olympic career at a home Games at Lillehammer in 1994 but won his first medals four years later in Nagano.</p>
			<p>Fact4: Although his results are far from his usual standards, he does not seem to wear down and still has the hunger of a young wolf</p>
