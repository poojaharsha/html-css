            <p>My Research about Sushi</p>
            <p>A sushi roll is a food of Asian origin that features rice and seafood wrapped in seaweed (nori). Until the end of the twentieth century, sushi rolls were only available in restaurants. Today, a number of companies prepare them for retail sale in grocery stores. Although a few of these companies use mechanical sushi makers—called robots—to shape the rice and add condiments, the finest quality sushi rolls are still handmade. Although variety of seafood is used in sushi rolls, including shrimp (ebi), crab (kani), and salmon (sake), tuna (maguro) is by far the most popular.

            <p>How to order?</p>
            Even if you're an experienced sushi eater, ordering can be a very intimidating process. some tips that'll help novices look like they know what they're doing when they sit down at the bar.
            <ul>
                <li>Sit at the bar It's best to get a front-row seat rather than slumming it in the nosebleeds. You'll get a stronger appreciation of the care that goes into your food, and no one has more knowledge of the menu and freshness of the fish than the chef.</li>
                <li>Trust your server If you're feeling brave, then order "omakase" style ("I'll leave it to you") and let the chef make the decisions. But whether you're ordering a la carte or letting the chef pick, offer your server suggestions of what you like in terms of texture and intensity.</li>
                <li>Don't be afraid to ask questions Odds are your server didn't know anything about sushi when they started working in the industry, so don't feel embarrassed if you don't have a nuanced understanding of the difference between blue and yellowfin tuna, or don't have three semesters worth of Japanese language classes under your kimono.</li>
                <li>Don't order everything at once Order a few things at once, and your honest reactions will help guide your server to make sure you're getting flavors that match your palate.</li>
                <li>Don't ask for soy sauce and wasabi if they're not served It overwhelms the flavors, and chances are the chef already gave it a delicate brush of soy. Wasabi and ginger are used as palate cleansers, not entrees.</li>
                <li>Avoid flashy rolls Rolls with lots of different kinds of fish or rainbow sauces are generally frowned upon by experts because it's hard for the individual flavors to shine. The chef we talked to recommends basic tekka maki (tuna roll), umeshiso maki (a roll with plum paste and shiso leaves), or a California roll with real crab.</li>
                <li>Seek out the specialties Ask what the restaurant is known for, or if there are dishes that are particularly indicative of the restaurant's style. It will be viewed as a sign of respect and also allow the chef to put his best foot forward.</li>
                <li>When in a traditional sushi bar, sashimi should be ordered before sushi This comes from Morimoto camp, so you know it's ironclad. Work your way up to rolls: they're considered the main course. And while it seems like you might want to start with a bowl of miso, traditional chefs would serve this last.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>What are the ways that grocery store sushi is different from serious sushi?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The rice. It's too mushy... or too dry.</li>
                <li>They're not starting from the whole fish</li>
                <li>The wasabi isn't fresh (and might not even be wasabi).</li>
