            <p>Is there an actual medical disorder associated with it? If so, what is it and how is it treated?</p>
            <p>
                There is a medical disorder associated with it. FAD, or Facebook Addiction Disorder: is a condition that is defined by hours spent on Facebook, so much time in fact that the healthy balance of the individual’s life is affected. It has been said that approximately 350 million people are suffering from the disorder. Treatment: Like with all mental disorders, there will be no easy fix. I think that to begin with we all need to take a good look at ourselves and our behavior. If you’re Facebook time is eating into your social time, or your sport time, or your study time, something has gone seriously wrong. You need to go back and readjust, because to keep a healthy balance is the key to a happy, healthy life. It won’t be easy, and it certainly won’t happen overnight, but eventually we are going to be forced to fix this Facebook overload and cure the entire world of FAD. One can only hope.

            <p>Find one example in a news or journal article of a person who was "addicted" to using a social networking site or other online activity - why was their behavior considered addictive? Were they able to modify their behavior?</p>
            <p>
                A blog post by social media marketer Jason Thibeault, "Why I just quit Facebook," is sparking new debate about the risks of social media addiction. He was a facebook addict. His behaviour was considered addictive since he his news feeds were becoming an addiction. They were a constant interruption pulling him away from the work that he was otherwise enjoying. He recieved treatment for conditions like depression or anxiety and there was "improvement of symptoms of Internet addiction"

            <p>I have been concerned about becoming addicted to facebook as it is the most fun site to kill boredom. But after investigating the addiction, we should be careful and limit our usage. </p>
